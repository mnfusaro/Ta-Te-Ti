##Ta-Te-Ti !

####Prerequisites
You just need to have __python >= 3.5__ installed.

####Installing
To run this game on your pc you just need:
 
1. Clone this repository:
`git clone git@github.com:mnfusaro/Ta-Te-Ti.git`
2. `cd` to the project directory.
3. Open a terminal and type `python3 user_interface.py` and enjoy.

####Challenges
This was a fun project, the biggest challenge was to separate responsibilities in the code.

Should the Board know when a user win? or even what does winning mean?<br/>Probably not. That seems more responsibility of the Game.<br/>
But, could / should the board know if it has 3 contiguous positions with the same mark?<br/>That doesn't sound so bad.
